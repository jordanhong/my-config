# My-config

This is the repository where I store a copy of my own configurations, mostly Vim and Unix based.

## My Philosopy
My standards for a developer environment is:

1. Clean.
2. Light-weight, easy to install and re-install.
3. Configurable to my own liking.

Therefore, if something is Vim-built-in and relatively easy to pick up, I will use the vim version instead of external plug-ins. I try to keep my set-up as clean as possible. 


## Installation Guide: From a clean new environment to configured.
