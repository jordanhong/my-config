# My-config

This is the repository where I store a copy of my own configurations of Terminal command line and Vim profile. 

## My Philosopy
My standards for a development environment is:

1. Clean.
2. Light-weight, easy to install and re-install.
3. Configurable to my own liking.

Therefore, I use VIM, which is a powerful, extensible general text-editor. I adopt minimalism in my setup config files. I install only the necessary plugins for my usage. If a function is built-in and simple, I prefer learning the command rather than relying on plugins.  

## Installation Guide: From a clean new environment to configured.
